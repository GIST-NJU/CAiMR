# Subjects

This directory contains 11 subject programs, each located in a folder named after the subject.

Each subject folder includes two subdirectories: `output` and `versions`.

---

### `output/`

This directory is used to store the output files generated by running the CAiMR approach.

---

### `versions/`

This directory contains one original version of the subject and multiple faulty versions:
- The original version is placed in the subdirectory named `0`.
- Faulty versions are placed in subdirectories named `1`, `2`, ..., `n`, where `n` is the total number of injected faulty versions.

All subject programs were compiled and tested under the following environment:
- Ubuntu 22.04  
- JDK 11  
- g++ 11  

If your environment differs, it is recommended that you **recompile the subject programs** to ensure compatibility.
